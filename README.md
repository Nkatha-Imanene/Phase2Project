## Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive analysis and recommendation system for movies. It aims to provide insights into the movie industry by analyzing various factors such as profits, genre popularity, and optimal release times. The project leverages SQL, statistical methods, and hypothesis testing to extract meaningful insights that can help new movie studios make informed decisions.
Here is an interactive dashboard for this analysis [Click here](https://public.tableau.com/views/MoviesRecommendationAnalysis/MovieRecommendationAnalysis?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
## Business Problem

Our company has noticed that many major players are creating original video content, and we want to join the trend. We've decided to launch a new movie studio, but we lack experience in filmmaking. I've been tasked with exploring which types of films are currently performing best at the box office. My goal is to translate these findings into actionable insights that our studio head can use to make informed decisions about the types of films we should produce.

The main business questions this project sought to answer were:
 * 1. What is the total profit generated by movies based on their genres, and which genres are the most profitable?
 * 2. Which movie genre is the most popular among audiences?
 * 3. When is the optimal time to release a movie to maximize profits?
   
 ## Data Understanding and Analysis
 For this project we have 6 data sources:

1. bom.movie_gross.csv: This is a file that contains information regarding a movies name, both domestic and foreign gross amount and the year it was released

2. im.db:This is a zipped folder that contains a database called im which contains data regarding a movie. This data includes what category it falls under, the direcctor, actors involved, movie ratings, running time and many more

3. rt.movie_info.tsv: This file has information the movie rating for theatrical releases e.g. 'R' 'PG 13' e.t.c. it also tells more about the movie like genre, director, theatrical release date, dvd release date, runtime, box office gross and studio
4. rt.reviews.tsv: This is a list of reviews from reviewers and and the ratings they gave, it also gives info on who published the review

5. tmdb.movies.csv: Here we have genre ids, movie titles, language the movie is in, its popularity, release date,vote count and the average vote

6. tn.movie_budgets.csv: This file contains a movies production budget, domestic gross and worlwide gross

# Data Description
In order to take a closer look at the data sources, all the necessary libraries were first imported. All the above datasets were then loaded  and analyzed to gain better insight on the data. One of the files was a zipped file which had to be unzipped first in order to access the data within it.
After loading the datasets, it was easier to find related columns that could be used to connect two or more tables.

We determined the total gross profit by genre using a series of code and the results displayed in a graph as shown below for better visualization:

We determined the popularity of movie genres among customers by analyzing the ratings given to various movies. We obtained this information by merging the `movie_basics` table with the `movie_ratings` table. The results are displayed in the bar graph, which shows the popularity of genres by count.

From the graph above, we can observe the following:
* Drama is the most popular genre, boasting a large following.
* The top five genres in terms of popularity are Drama, Documentary, Comedy, Thriller, and Horror, with only the first three surpassing a popularity count of 15,000.

The most appropriate time to release a movie in order to make the most amount of profit was analyzed by looking at the movie budgets table. A line graph showing the average profits of each month over the years was plotted as shown for better visualization.

From the above graph we can deduce that;
* There is high growth in interest in between the month of April and May and the same for October to November
* Movies released in the months May,June,July and November have yielded the most gross profits.
* Movies released in January,April,Aug,September and October have yielded the least profits.


## Conclusion
1. What is the total profit made by movies depending on the genres? And which genres have the most profit?
We focused on the top five genres: Drama, Adventure, Action, Comedy, and Fantasy. These genres are the most profitable and are recommended for new studios provided they can match or exceed the production budgets typically associated with these films.

2. What is the most popular movie genre among customers?
We analyzed vote counts and average ratings for each genre. Drama emerged as the most popular genre, followed by Documentary and Comedy. The average ratings across genres were relatively similar, with no significant differences.

3. When is the most appropriate time to release a movie to maximize profits?
The data revealed two peak profit periods: early April to May, and October to November. Movies released during these months have the highest potential for profit.


## Recomendations
* It is advisable to start with a middle tier movie genre such as Thriller, Sci-Fi or Animation, as a way to build raport among customers and to build the name of the company's studio, since the company will be venturing into the movie business as a beginner. 

* Release dates for any movies to be made in the months of April and October since those have beeen seen to have a rise in profits.
